## Hi there 👋

I'm a full stack software developer currently based in New Zealand.

I'm fascinated by how computer technology 🌐 has transformed the world in ways we never imagined.  
I love exploring new tech stacks 💻, building smart, useful tools 🛠️, and diving into everything from web apps to AI integrations 🤖.

I've worked on projects involving cloud platforms, chatbots, AI vehicle prediction systems, and management systems across education and e-commerce.
